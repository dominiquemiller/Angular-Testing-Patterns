# Angular-Testing-Patterns
Sample testing patterns for Angular Projects.
My goal is have a single reference for my Angular testing questions.  It will also serve as a 
playground to experiment with different testing techniques or scenarios.

Angular Community! Please feel free to add to this project or improve on the exisitng tests!

## Usage
Be sure to have the Angular CLI tool installed in your development environment. If you need help 
installing the Angular CLI tool go [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

From your terminal type `ng test` to run unit / intergration tests or `ng e2e` ro run the end-to-end tests.
